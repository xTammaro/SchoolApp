/**
* This Java class will create a singleton instance of the open source executive function assessment by Adolphe et al. (2022).
* The user should be able to access the singleton instance of the executive function assessment through the public interface.
*
* The proposed code will be as follows:
*	// The javax.script.* import allows the javascript exec function test to be launched via java app.
*	import javax.script.*;
*	import java.io.*;
*
* 	*
*	// Public class implementing the interface. This will be how the user accesses/manipulates the test (user view)
*
*	public class executiveFunctionAssess implements executiveFunctionInterface<> {
*
*	// The executive function assessment is instantiated using the Nashorn JS engine.
*	// https://www.javatpoint.com/java-nashorn

*	// This private call is a work in progress. This is used by the constructor to create a single instance of
*	// the executive function test to the user.
*
*		private static ScriptEngine executiveFunctionScript = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(Nashorn)
*
*	// This private call creates an array of size (to be determined based on the assessment's output). The user's
*	// instance of the assessment will save their code to this dictionary.
*
*		private static List<Integer> executiveFunctionResults = new ArrayList<>;
*
*		private static executiveFunctionAsses executiveFunctionInstance = null;
*
*		protected executiveFunctionAssess() {}
*
*		public static executiveFunctionAssess getInstance() {

			if (executiveFunctionInstance == null) {
				System.out.println("New instance created!");
				executiveFunctionInstance = new executiveFunctionAssess
			}
			else {
				System.out.println("Instance already exists!");
			}
			// Else return current assessment instance.
			return executiveFunctionInstance;
*			}
*
*	TODO: Add overrides for array. Add interface commands so that user can properly interact with executive function assessment.
* 	This will require some experimentation.
*   TODO: Right now, the top goal is to launch the app through a java console, and see how interactive it is without modification. - Nick
